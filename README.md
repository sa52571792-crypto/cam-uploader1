# Camera Capture & Upload (Consent-based)
This project shows a simple web page that asks for camera permission, lets a user capture a photo, and **automatically uploads** it to a server you control. You can then open `/gallery` from your phone to view photos as they arrive.

## Run locally
1. Install Node.js (v16+).
2. In this folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 on the same device. Camera works on **localhost** without HTTPS.
4. To test from another phone on your Wiâ€‘Fi, use your computer's LAN IP and port 3000 AND HTTPS is required by most mobile browsers for camera on non-localhost. For quick tests, run it on the phone itself, or deploy to an HTTPS host.

## Deploy (HTTPS)
Use any Node hosting (Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.). They provide HTTPS by default.
- After deploy, share the site URL with your friend.
- Your friend taps **Allow** for camera.
- When they hit **Capture & Upload**, the image is uploaded to your server into `/uploads`.
- You can view images at `/gallery` or directly via the returned URL.

## Legal
- Always get explicit consent. Browsers show a camera permission prompt by design. Don't attempt to bypass it.
